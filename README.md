# K1CStuffHolder
A 3D STL that creates a holder for the default items that come with the Creality K1C

This object was created for personal use and then I'm happy to just make it public for if anyone else want to use it.
It has 5 holes in a row for the tubes containing various hot ends. The K1C allows for 0.2, 0.4,0.6,0.8, and 1mm nozzles so there is a space for one of each.
There is also a hole for a a standard vernier caliper device.
There is a hole for the large right angled socket that comes with the K1C to remove the nozzle.
There are three tall slots meant for the allen keys that come with the K1C though obviously these can be used for anything.
There is a tall wide slot bin on the left meant for a gluestick or just random bits and screws.
There is a large open slot at the front meant for the pliers that come with the K1C.
There is a very narrow hole at the top near the nozzle holders that is meant for the long thin metal stick that comes with the K1C for cleaning the extruder.
There is a small outsticking nub for hanging a bed scraper from. It was meant for the one that came with the K1c but will fit many others. It's possible to 3D print great bed scrapers.

Please enjoy and let me know if you like it. You are welcome to use this item for free, modify it, remix it, share it, even sell it as a file or physical printed object. I would just appreciate a link to this page if you do,

My logo is cut into the bottom out of sight. Any printer capable of the most trivial of bridging will have no issue with this.

I designed this to be printed ont eh Creality K1C with an 0.2mm nozzle. I have not tested with alternate sizes. May require editing.
